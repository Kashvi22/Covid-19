            <p class="p_modal">Worldometer, formerly Worldometers (plural), is a reference website that provides
              counters and real-time statistics for diverse topics. It is owned and operated by a data company Dadax
              which generates revenue through online advertising.
              <br>
              In early 2020, the website gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It came under cyber attack in
              March 2020. The site was hit with a DDoS attack, and was then hacked a few days later, resulting in
              incorrect information being shown on its COVID-19 statistics page for approximately 20 minutes. The hacked
              site showed a dramatic rise in COVID-19 cases in Vatican City, which caused panic among some users of
              social media. The Spanish government used its figures to claim that it had carried out more tests than all
              but four other countries. Worldometers' COVID-19 figures have also been cited by Financial Times, The
              New York Times, The Washington Post, Fox News, CNN, and Rede Globo.

              Worldometer has faced criticism over transparency of ownership, lack of citations to data sources, and
              unreliability of its COVID-19 statistics and rankings. The website reported that 18,000 people recovered
              from COVID-19 in Spain on April 24, compared to the Spanish government figure of 3,105 recoveries for that
              day. Furthermore, the website omits the data for the Kosovo at all.<br> <a

      <p>
        If you have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and you're caring for yourself at home or you're caring for a
        loved one with COVID-19 at home, you might have questions. How do you know when emergency care is needed? How
        long is isolation necessary? What can you do to prevent the spread of germs? How can you support a sick loved
        one and manage your stress? Here's what you need to know.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <label id="Question_logic">At-home treatment</label>
      <p>
        Most people who become sick with COVID-19 will only experience mild illness and can recover at home. Symptoms
        might last a few days, and people who have the virus might feel better in about a week. Treatment is aimed at
        relieving symptoms and includes rest, fluid intake and pain relievers.
        <br>
        However, older adults and people of any age with existing medical conditions should call their doctor as soon as
        symptoms start. These factors put people at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.
        <br>
        Follow the doctor's recommendations about care and home isolation for yourself or your loved one. Talk to the
        doctor if you have any questions about treatments. Help the sick person get groceries and any medications and,
        if needed, take care of his or her pet.
        <br>
        It's also important to consider how caring for a sick person might affect your health. If you are older or have
        an existing medical condition, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, you may be at higher risk of serious
        illness with COVID-19. You might consider isolating yourself from the sick person and finding another person to
        provide care.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Emergency warning signs</label>
      <p>
        Carefully monitor yourself or your loved one for worsening symptoms. If symptoms appear to be getting worse,
        call the doctor.
        <br>
        The doctor might recommend use of a home pulse oximeter, especially if the ill person has risk factors for
        severe illness with COVID-19 and COVID-19 symptoms. A pulse oximeter is a plastic clip that attaches to a
        finger. The device can help check breathing by measuring how much oxygen is in the blood. A reading of less than
        92% might increase the need for hospitalization. If the doctor recommends a pulse oximeter, make sure you
        understand how to use the device properly and when a reading should prompt a call to the doctor.
        <br>
        If you or the person with COVID-19 experiences emergency warning signs, medical attention is needed immediately.
        Call 911 or your local emergency number if the sick person can't be woken up or you notice any emergency signs,
        including:
        <br>
        1.Trouble breathing
        <br>
        2.Persistent chest pain or pressure
        <br>
        3.Bluish lips or face
        <br>
        4.Inability to stay awake
        <br>
        5.Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds â€” depending on skin tone
        <br>
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Protecting others if you're ill</label>
      <p>
        If you're ill with COVID-19, you can help prevent the spread of infection with the COVID-19 virus.
        <br>
        1.Stay home from work, school and public areas unless it's to get medical care.
        <br>
        2.Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing services or taxis.
        <br>
        3.Stay isolated in one room, away from your family and other people, as much as possible. This includes eating
        in your room. Open windows to keep air circulating. Use a separate bathroom, if possible.
        <br>
        4.Avoid shared space in your home as much as possible. When using shared spaces, limit your movements. Keep your
        kitchen and other shared spaces well ventilated. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from your family members.
        <br>
        5.Clean often-touched surfaces in your separate room and bathroom, such as doorknobs, light switches,
        electronics and counters, every day.
        <br>
        6.Avoid sharing personal household items, such as dishes, towels, bedding and electronics.
        <br>
        7.Wear a face mask when near others. Change the face mask each day.
        <br>
        8.If wearing a face mask isn't possible, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or
        sneezing.
        <br>
        9.Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
        that contains at least 60% alcohol.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Protecting yourself while caring for someone with COVID-19</label>
      <p>
        To protect yourself while caring for someone with COVID-19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend:
        <br>
        1.Keep your hands clean and away from your face. Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20
        seconds, especially after being in close contact or in the same room as the sick person. If soap and water
        aren't available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and
        mouth.
        <br>
        2.Wear a face mask. If you need to be in the same room with the person who is ill and he or she isn't able to
        wear a face mask, wear a face mask. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from the ill person. Don't touch or
        handle your mask while you are using it. If your mask gets wet or dirty, replace it with a clean, dry mask.
        Throw away the used mask and wash your hands.
        <br>
        3.Be careful with laundry. Don't shake dirty laundry. Use regular detergent to wash the sick person's laundry.
        Use the warmest setting you can. Wash your hands after putting clothes in the dryer. Thoroughly dry clothes. If
        you are handling clothing that has been soiled by the sick person, wear disposable gloves and keep the items
        away from your body. Wash your hands after removing the gloves. Place dirty gloves and masks in a waste bin with
        a lid in the sick person's room. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers and wash your hands afterward.
        <br>
        4.Be careful with dishes. Wear gloves when handling dishes, cups or utensils used by the sick person. Wash the
        items with soap and hot water or in the dishwasher. Clean your hands after taking off the gloves or handling
        used items.
        <br>
        5.Avoid direct contact with the sick person's bodily fluids. Wear disposable gloves and a face mask when
        providing oral and respiratory care and when handling stool, urine or other waste. Wash your hands before and
        after removing your gloves and mask. Don't reuse your mask or gloves.
        <br>
        6.Avoid having unnecessary visitors in your home. Don't allow visitors until the sick person has completely
        recovered and has no signs or symptoms of COVID-19.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Ending isolation or quarantine</label>
      <p>
        Talk to the doctor about when to end home isolation, especially if you have a weakened immune system. The CDC
        recommends the following guidelines for ending home isolation after you think or know you had COVID-19.
        <br>
        1.If you won't have a test to determine if you're still contagious, you can leave your sick room or home if at
        least 10 days have passed since your symptoms started, at least 24 hours have passed with no fever without the
        use of fever-reducing medicine and other symptoms are improving. Loss of taste and smell might last for weeks or
        months after recovery but shouldn't delay ending isolation.
        <br>
        2.If you'll be tested to determine if you're still contagious, your doctor will let you know when you can be
        around others based on your test results. Most people don't need testing to decide when they can be around
        others.
        <br>
        <br>
        The CDC also recommends that, as the sick person's caregiver, you quarantine for 14 days and watch for common
        signs and symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other options may include ending
        quarantine after 10 days if you don't have symptoms and won't get tested or ending quarantine after 7 days if
        you receive a negative test result on day 5 or later. But continue to watch for symptoms for 14 days.
        <br>
        However, if youâ€™ve been caring for someone with COVID-19, you donâ€™t need to stay home if:
        <br>
        1.Youâ€™ve been fully vaccinated and have no symptoms of COVID-19.
        <br>
        2.Youâ€™ve had COVID-19 within the last three months, recovered and remain without symptoms of COVID-19.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Coping with caregiving stress</label>
      <p>
        As you or your loved one recover, seek emotional support. Stay connected to others through texts, phone calls or
        videoconferences. Share your concerns. Avoid too much COVID-19 news. Rest and focus on enjoyable activities,
        such as reading, watching movies or playing online games.
        <br>
        As you take care of a loved one who is ill with COVID-19, you might feel stressed too. You might worry about
        your health and the health of the sick person. This can affect your ability to eat, sleep and concentrate, as
        well as worsen chronic health problems. It may also increase your use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
        <br>
        If you have a mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression, continue with your treatment. Contact your
        doctor or mental health professional if your condition worsens.
        <br>
        To care for yourself, follow these steps:
        <br>
        1.Maintain a daily routine, including showering and getting dressed.
        <br>
        2.Take breaks from COVID-19 news, including social media.
        <br>
        3.Eat healthy meals and stay hydrated.
        <br>
        4.Exercise.
        <br>
        5.Get plenty of sleep.
        <br>
        6.Avoid excessive use of alcohol and tobacco.
        <br>
        7.Stretching, breathe deeply or meditate.
        <br>
        8.Focus on enjoyable activities.
        <br>
        9.Connect with others and share how you are feeling.
        <br>
        Caring for yourself can help you cope with stress. It will also help you be able to support your loved one's
        recovery.

      <p>
        About 1.3 million people are now receiving the COVID-19 vaccine every day, and some states are starting to allow
        people with certain comorbidities to get the shot. On February 8, New York's Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said
        residents with comorbidities and underlying conditions could make appointments at state-run mass vaccination
        sites from February 14.
        <br>
        But what are comorbiditiesâ€”and how do they affect COVID-19? Here's what expert told us, plus how to know if you
        have one.
        <br>
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Comorbidities definition</label>
      <p>
        "Comorbidities are the presence of two or more diseases in the same person," Jooby Babu, MD, pulmonologist and
        critical care specialist at Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Southern California, tells Health. "For instance,
        a person who has diabetes and hypertension, or diabetes and kidney failure."
        <br>
        The term comorbidity was first documented in the 1970s by renowned doctor and epidemiologist A.R. Feinstein, who
        used people who suffered from rheumatic fever and multiple other diseases as examples.
        <br>
        RELATED: Nearly 90% of People Hospitalized for COVID-19 Have Underlying Conditions, Says CDC
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">How do comorbidities affect COVID-19?</label>
      <p>
        In June 2020, a study published in SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine investigated the belief that COVID-19 in a
        person with underlying health conditions or comorbidities "has an increasingly rapid and severe progression,
        often leading to death." The researchers looked at all the available data and found that having comorbidities
        also increases the chances of coronavirus infection. They also concluded that patients with a history of
        hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease have the worst prognosis and
        most often end up with deteriorating outcomes, such as the life-threatening lung injury ARDS (acute respiratory
        distress syndrome) and pneumonia.
        <br>
        Comorbidities are a serious health concern, Dr. Babu says, because the presence of two or more conditions
        increases the chances of hospitalization and the risk of death and affects quality of life. When a person
        experiences comorbid conditions, they may have a compromised immune system or need additional care that exposes
        them to others. Plus, they may already be experiencing complications from the underlying condition that puts
        increased stress on their body. According to a study published by the Annals of Family Medicine, "Comorbidity is
        associated with worse health outcomes, more complex clinical management, and increased health care costs."
        <br>
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">CDC list of comorbid conditions</label>
      <p>
        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a list of comorbid conditions in COVID-19
        patients, which includes cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, Down syndrome, obesity, pregnancy, and
        type 2 diabetes mellitus.
        <br>
        RELATED: 5 Preexisting Conditions That Can Make It Harder to Fight Coronavirus
        <br>
        Because COVID-19 is a new disease, there's not a lot of data on how other underling conditions affect COVID-19
        severity. But the CDC says there might be an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 if the patient also
        has moderate to severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, hypertension (high blood pressure), dementia, and type 1
        diabetes mellitus, among other conditions.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Comorbidities and the COVID-19 vaccine</label>
      <p>
        The opportunity to get the COVID-19 vaccine comes as welcome news to those who live with chronic health
        conditions. For Dr. Babu, it's an important development. "Patients with comorbidities should get vaccinated as
        early as possible," he says.
        <br>
        Whether you've been vaccinated or not, if you live with a chronic health condition, it's even more important
        that you follow the hygiene and safety guidelines set out by the CDC. In other words, limit person-to-person
        contact, wear masks in public areas, and be super vigilant about hand washing with soap and water or hand
        sanitizer.
        <br>
        RELATED: CDC Says 'Severely Obese' People Are at Greater Risk for COVID-19 Complicationsâ€”But Are They Really?\
        <br>
        It's also important to reduce the risk of medication interactions, so if you live with multiple conditions or
        disorders, make sure your doctor knows all prescribed med and over-the-counter drugs you're taking.

      <label id="Question_logic">Summary</label>
      <p>
        The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come
        into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions
        on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological
        impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review.
        Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms,
        confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom,
        inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested
        long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine
        individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols,
        and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of
        quarantine to wider society can be favourable.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Introduction</label>
      <p>
        Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a
        contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, so reducing the risk of them infecting others.1 This
        definition differs from isolation, which is the separation of people who have been diagnosed with a contagious
        disease from people who are not sick; however, the two terms are often used interchangeably, especially in
        communication with the public.2 The word quarantine was first used in Venice, Italy in 1127 with regards to
        leprosy and was widely used in response to the Black Death, although it was not until 300 years later that the
        UK properly began to impose quarantine in response to plague.3 Most recently, quarantine has been used in the
        coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This outbreak has seen entire cities in China effectively placed
        under mass quarantine, while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from China have been asked to
        self-isolate at home or in state-run facilities.4 There are precedents for such measures. Citywide quarantines
        were also imposed in areas of China and Canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
        (SARS), whereas entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Why is this Review needed?</label>
      <p>
        Quarantine is often an unpleasant experience for those who undergo it. Separation from loved ones, the loss of
        freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects. Suicide has
        been reported,5 substantial anger generated, and lawsuits brought6 following the imposition of quarantine in
        previous outbreaks. The potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the
        possible psychological costs.7 Successful use of quarantine as a public health measure requires us to reduce, as
        far as possible, the negative effects associated with it.
        <br>
        Given the developing situation with coronavirus, policy makers urgently need evidence synthesis to produce
        guidance for the public. In circumstances such as these, rapid reviews are recommended by WHO.8 We undertook a
        Review of evidence on the psychological impact of quarantine to explore its likely effects on mental health and
        psychological wellbeing, and the factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. Of 3166 papers found,
        24 are included in this Review (figure). The characteristics of studies that met our inclusion criteria are
        presented in the table. These studies were done across ten countries and included people with SARS (11 studies),
        Ebola (five), the 2009 and 2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic (three), Middle East respiratory syndrome (two), and
        equine influenza (one). One of these studies related to both H1N1 and SARS.

      <label id="Question_logic">The psychological impact of quarantine</label>
      <p>
        Five studies compared psychological outcomes for people quarantined with those not quarantined. A study of
        hospital staff who might have come into contact with SARS found that immediately after the quarantine period (9
        days) ended, having been quarantined was the factor most predictive of symptoms of acute stress disorder. In the
        same study, quarantined staff were significantly more likely to report exhaustion, detachment from others,
        anxiety when dealing with febrile patients, irritability, insomnia, poor concentration and indecisiveness,
        deteriorating work performance, and reluctance to work or consideration of resignation. In another study, the
        effect of being quarantined was a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospital employees even 3 years
        later. Approximately 34% (938 of 2760) of horse owners quarantined for several weeks because of an equine
        influenza outbreak reported high psychological distress during the outbreak, compared with around 12% in the
        Australian general population. A study comparing post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents and children
        quarantined with those not quarantined found that the mean post-traumatic stress scores were four times higher
        in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined. 28% (27 of 98) of parents
        quarantined in this study reported sufficient symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of a trauma-related mental health
        disorder, compared with 6% (17 of 299) of parents who were not quarantined. Another study of hospital staff
        examined symptoms of depression 3 years after quarantine and found that 9% (48 of 549) of the whole sample
        reported high depressive symptoms. In the group with high depressive symptoms, nearly 60% (29 of 48) had been
        quarantined but only 15% (63 of 424) of the group with low depressive symptoms had been quarantined.
        <br>
        All other quantitative studies only surveyed those who had been quarantined and generally reported a high
        prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress and disorder. Studies reported on general psychological
        symptoms, emotional disturbance, depression, stress, low mood, irritability, insomnia, post-traumatic stress
        symptoms (rated on Weiss and Marmar's Impact of Event Scaleâ€“Revised), anger, and emotional exhaustion. Low mood
        (660 [73%] of 903) and irritability (512 [57%] of 903) stand out as having high prevalence.
        <br>
        People quarantined because of being in close contact with those who potentially have SARS reported various
        negative responses during the quarantine period: over 20% (230 of 1057) reported fear, 18% (187) reported
        nervousness, 18% (186) reported sadness, and 10% (101) reported guilt. Few reported positive feelings: 5% (48)
        reported feelings of happiness and 4% (43) reported feelings of relief. Qualitative studies also identified a
        range of other psychological responses to quarantine, such as confusion, fear, anger, grief, numbness, and
        anxiety-induced insomnia.
        <br>
        One study compared undergraduates who had been quarantined with those not quarantined immediately after the
        quarantine period and found no significant difference between the groups in terms of post-traumatic stress
        symptoms or general mental health problems. However, the entire study population were undergraduate students
        (who are generally young, and perhaps have fewer responsibilities than adults who are employed full-time) and
        thus it is possible that these conclusions cannot be generalised to the wider population.
        <br>
        Only one study compared psychological outcomes during quarantine with later outcomes and found that during
        quarantine, 7% (126 of 1656) showed anxiety symptoms and 17% (275) showed feelings of anger, whereas 4â€“6 months
        after quarantine these symptoms had reduced to 3% (anxiety) and 6% (anger).
        <br>
        Two studies reported on longer-term effects of quarantine. 3 years after the SARS outbreak, alcohol abuse or
        dependency symptoms were positively associated with having been quarantined in health-care workers. In a
        multivariate analysis, after controlling for demographic factors, having been quarantined and having worked in a
        high-risk location were the two types of exposure significantly associated with these outcomes (for quarantine:
        unadjusted mean ratio 0Â·45; 95% CI 1Â·02â€“2Â·65).
        <br>
        After quarantine, many participants continued to engage in avoidance behaviours. For health-care workers, being
        quarantined was significantly and positively associated with avoidance behaviours, such as minimising direct
        contact with patients and not reporting to work. A study of people quarantined because of potential SARS contact
        noted that 54% (524 of 1057) of people who had been quarantined avoided people who were coughing or sneezing,
        26% (255) avoided crowded enclosed places, and 21% (204) avoided all public spaces in the weeks following the
        quarantine period. A qualitative study reported that several participants described long-term behavioural
        changes after the quarantine period, such as vigilant handwashing and avoidance of crowds and, for some, the
        return to normality was delayed by many months.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Prequarantine predictors of psychological impact</label>
      <p>
        There was mixed evidence for whether participant characteristics and demographics were predictors of the
        psychological impact of quarantine. A study of horse owners quarantined because of equine influenza identified
        several characteristics associated with negative psychological impacts: younger age (16â€“24 years), lower levels
        of formal educational qualifications, female gender, and having one child as opposed to no children (although
        having three or more children appeared somewhat protective). However, another study suggested that demographic
        factors such as marital status, age, education, living with other adults, and having children were not
        associated with psychological outcomes.
        <br>
        Having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 4â€“6 months after
        release from quarantine. Health-care workers who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic
        stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all
        dimensions. Health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more
        avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected
        psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness,
        isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Health-care workers were also
        substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others. Conversely, one
        study suggested that health-care worker status was not associated with psychological outcomes.
      </p>
      <label id="Question_logic">Stressors during quarantine</label>
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Duration of quarantine</label>
      <br>
      Three studies showed that longer durations of quarantine were associated with poorer mental health specifically,
      post-traumatic stress symptoms, avoidance behaviours, and anger. Although the duration of the quarantine was not
      always clear, one study showed that those quarantined for more than 10 days showed significantly higher
      post-traumatic stress symptoms than those quarantined for less than 10 days.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Fears of infection</label>
      <br>
      Participants in eight studies reported fears about their own health or fears of infecting others and were more
      likely to fear infecting family members than those not quarantined. They also became particularly worried if they
      experienced any physical symptoms potentially related to the infection and fear that the symptoms could reflect
      having the infection continued to be related to psychological outcomes several months later. Conversely, one study
      found that although very few participants were extremely concerned about becoming infected or transmitting the
      virus to others, those who were concerned tended to be pregnant women and those with young children.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Frustration and boredom</label>
      <br>
      Confinement, loss of usual routine, and reduced social and physical contact with others were frequently shown to
      cause boredom, frustration, and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world, which was distressing to
      participants. This frustration was exacerbated by not being able to take part in usual day-to-day activities, such
      as shopping for basic necessities or taking part in social networking activities via the telephone or internet.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Inadequate supplies</label>
      <br>
      Having inadequate basic supplies (eg, food, water, clothes, or accommodation) during quarantine was a source of
      frustration and continued to be associated with anxiety and anger 4â€“6 months after release. Being unable to get
      regular medical care and prescriptions also appeared to be a problem for some participants.
      <br>
      Four studies found that supplies from public health authorities were insufficient. Participants reported receiving
      their masks and thermometers late or not at all; food, water, and other items were only intermittently
      distributed; and food supplies took a long time to arrive. Although those quarantined during the Toronto SARS
      outbreak praised public health authorities for delivering kits of medical supplies at the beginning of the
      quarantine period, they did not receive groceries or other routine supplies needed for daily living.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic">Inadequate information</label>
      <br>
      Many participants cited poor information from public health authorities as a stressor, reporting insufficient
      clear guidelines about actions to take and confusion about the purpose of quarantine. After the Toronto SARS
      epidemic, participants perceived that confusion stemmed from the differences in style, approach, and content of
      various public health messages because of poor coordination between the multiple jurisdictions and levels of
      government involved. Lack of clarity about the different levels of risk, in particular, led to participants
      fearing the worst. Participants also reported a perceived lack of transparency from health and government
      officials about the severity of the pandemic. Perhaps related to the lack of clear guidelines or rationale,
      perceived difficulty with complying with quarantine protocols was a significant predictor of post-traumatic stress
      symptoms in one study.

      <label id="Question_logic">Stressors postquarantine</label>
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic">Finances</label>
      <br>
      Financial loss can be a problem during quarantine, with people unable to work and having to interrupt their
      professional activities with no advanced planning; the effects appear to be long lasting. In the reviewed studies,
      the financial loss as a result of quarantine created serious socioeconomic distress and was found to be a risk
      factor for symptoms of psychological disorders and both anger and anxiety several months after quarantine. One
      study found that respondents who were quarantined because of equine influenza, whose principal source of income
      was from a horse-related industry, were more than twice as likely to have high distress than those whose income
      was not from the industry. This finding is probably linked to economic effects but could also be related to
      disruption of social networks and loss of leisure activities. Notably, this study is exceptional in that
      occupation and exposure are confounded.
      <br>
      A study of people quarantined because of potential Ebola contact found that, although participants received
      financial assistance, some felt that the amount was insufficient and that it came too late; many felt wronged as
      the assistance they received did not cover their ongoing professional expenses. Many became dependent on their
      families to provide for them financially during quarantine which was often hard to accept and could cause
      conflicts. In one study, none of those quarantined in Toronto during SARS reported much financial hardship because
      employers or the government compensated them, but where that reimbursement was slow to arrive it caused those less
      financially well-off to struggle.
      <br>
      Potentially related to financial loss, participants with a combined annual household income of less than
      CAN$40â€ˆ000 showed significantly higher amounts of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. These symptoms
      are probably because those with lower incomes were more likely to be affected by the temporary loss of income than
      those with higher incomes.
      <br>
      People who are quarantined and have lower household incomes might require additional levels of support, along with
      those who lose earnings while in quarantine (ie, self-employed people who are unable to work or salaried staff who
      are unable to take paid leave). Financial reimbursements should be provided where possible and programmes
      developed to provide financial support throughout the quarantine period. Where appropriate, employers might also
      wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to, both to avoid
      financial loss and to stave off boredom, while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their
      most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic">Stigma</label>
      <br>
      Stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature, often continuing for some time after quarantine,
      even after containment of the outbreak. In a comparison of health-care workers quarantined versus those not
      quarantined, quarantined participants were significantly more likely to report stigmatisation and rejection from
      people in their local neighbourhoods, suggesting that there is stigma specifically surrounding people who had been
      quarantined. Participants in several studies reported that others were treating them differently: avoiding them,
      withdrawing social invitations, treating them with fear and suspicion, and making critical comments.
      <br>
      Several health-care workers involved in the Ebola outbreak in Senegal reported that quarantine had led their
      families to consider their jobs to be too risky, creating intra-household tension. In the same study, three
      participants reported being unable to resume their jobs after surveillance ended because their employers expressed
      fear of contagion.
      <br>
      Those quarantined during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia reported that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of
      minority groups in the community as families under quarantine were often said to belong to different ethnic
      groups, tribes, or religions and were perceived as dangerous because they were different. Perhaps because of this
      stigma, being quarantined led participants in this study to keep easily treatable, non-Ebola illnesses a secret
      and avoided seeking help.
      <br>
      General education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the
      general public can be beneficial to reduce stigmatisation, whereas more detailed information targeted at schools
      and workplaces might also be useful. It might also be that media reporting contributes to stigmatising attitudes
      in the general public; the media is a powerful influence on public attitudes and dramatic headlines and fear
      mongering have been shown to contribute to stigmatising attitudes in the past (eg, during the SARS outbreak). This
      issue highlights the need for public health officials to provide rapid, clear messages delivered effectively for
      the entire affected population to promote accurate understanding of the situation.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_logic">What can be done to mitigate the consequences of quarantine?</label>
      <br>
      During major infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be a necessary preventive measure. However, this Review
      suggests that quarantine is often associated with a negative psychological effect. During the period of quarantine
      this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can
      still be detected months or years laterâ€”albeit from a small number of studiesâ€” is more troubling and suggests the
      need to ensure that effective mitigation measures are put in place as part of the quarantine planning process.
      <br>
      In this regard, our results do not provide strong evidence that any particular demographic factors are risk
      factors of poor psychological outcomes after quarantine and therefore require specific attention. However, history
      of mental illness was only examined as a risk factor by one study. Previous literature suggests that psychiatric
      history is associated with psychological distress after experiencing any disaster-related trauma and it is likely
      that people with pre-existing poor mental health would need extra support during quarantine. There also appeared
      to be a high prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health-care workers, although there was mixed
      evidence as to whether this group were at higher risk for distress than non-health-care workers who were
      quarantined. For health-care workers, support from managers is essential in facilitating their return to work and
      managers should be aware of the potential risks for their staff who were quarantined so that they can prepare for
      early intervention.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Keep it as short as possible</label>
      <br>
      Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes, perhaps unsurprisingly, as it stands to reason
      that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for.
      Restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation
      periods, and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this, would minimise the effect on people. Evidence
      from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of
      quarantine, and not extending it. For people already in quarantine, an extension, no matter how small, is likely
      to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation.
      Imposing a cordon indefinitely on whole cities with no clear time limit (such as has been seen in Wuhan, China)
      might be more detrimental than strictly applied quarantine procedures limited to the period of incubation.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Give people as much information as possible</label>
      <br>
      People who are quarantined often feared being infected or infecting others. They also often have catastrophic
      appraisals of any physical symptoms experienced during the quarantine period. This fear is a common occurrence for
      people exposed to a worrying infectious disease, and might be exacerbated by the often inadequate information
      participants reported receiving from public health officials leaving them unclear of the nature of the risks they
      faced and why they were being quarantined at all. Ensuring that those under quarantine have a good understanding
      of the disease in question, and the reasons for quarantine, should be a priority.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic">Provide adequate supplies</label>
      <br>
      Officials also need to ensure that quarantined households have enough supplies for their basic needs and,
      importantly, these must be provided as rapidly as possible. Coordination for provision of supplies should ideally
      occur in advance, with conservation and reallocation plans established to ensure resources do not run out, which
      unfortunately has been reported.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Reduce the boredom and improve the communication</label>
      <br>
      Boredom and isolation will cause distress; people who are quarantined should be advised about what they can do to
      stave off boredom and provided with practical advice on coping and stress management techniques. Having a working
      mobile phone is now a necessity, not a luxury, and those stepping off a long flight to enter quarantine will
      probably welcome a charger or adaptor more than anything else. Activating your social network, albeit remotely, is
      not just a key priority, but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer- term
      distress. One study suggested that having a telephone support line, staffed by psychiatric nurses, set up
      specifically for those in quarantine could be effective in terms of providing them with a social network. The
      ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an
      important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved
      ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with
      mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them
      to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic. Although this is
      possible to achieve in enforced quarantine, it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home
      quarantine; countries imposing censors on social media and messaging applications could also present difficulties
      in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved ones.
      <br>
      It is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined
      about what to do if they experience any symptoms. A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in
      quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of
      developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill. This
      service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are
      just as important as those of the wider public. The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is
      likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger.
      <br>
      There is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during
      disease outbreaks can be helpful. One study
      found that having such a group and feeling connected to others who had been through the same situation could be a
      validating, empowering experience and can provide people with the support they might find they are not receiving
      from other people.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Health-care workers deserve special attention</label>
      <br>
      Health-care workers themselves are often quarantined and this Review suggests they, like the general public, are
      negatively affected by stigmatising attitudes from others. None of the studies included in this Review focused on
      the perceptions of their colleagues, but this would be an interesting aspect to explore. It is also possible that
      health-care workers who are quarantined might be concerned about causing their workplaces to be understaffed and
      causing extra work for their colleagues and that their colleagues' perceptions could be particularly important.
      Being separated from a team they are used to working in close contact with might add to feelings of isolation for
      health-care workers who are quarantined. Therefore, it is essential that they feel supported by their immediate
      colleagues. During infectious disease outbreaks, organisational support has been found to be protective of mental
      health for health-care staff in general and managers should take steps to ensure their staff members are
      supportive of their colleagues who are quarantined.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_t_logic"> Altruism is better than compulsion</label>
      <br>
      Perhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study, no research was found which tested whether
      mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing. In other contexts, however, feeling
      that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely
      that this is also true for home-based quarantine. Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe,
      including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre-existing serious
      medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the
      mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined. Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being
      asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable
      to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be
      putting their loved ones at risk.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_logic">What we do not know</label>
      <br>
      Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in
      this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to
      whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing,
      cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to
      establish the effectiveness of such measures.
      <br>
      The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review
      given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal.
      Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant
      grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated
      facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor
      psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there
      are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review
      should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be
      considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work
      for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could
      be rectified in the future.
      <br>
      There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed
      up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants
      quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be
      generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make
      direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of
      post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not
      being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders 5.
      <br>
      Strengths of this Review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the
      initial search, contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online, and
      having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review.
      <br>
      <label id="Question_logic">Conclusion</label>
      <br>
      Overall, this Review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be
      long lasting. This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using
      quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse.
      However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled
      carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure
      that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is
      happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in
      quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are
      available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged
      with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should
      also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of
      this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the
      health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated
      it.
